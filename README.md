- 👋 Hi, I’m @DaniRomero
- 📫 How to reach me:
   - email: dara323@gmail.com
   - number: (787)225-6345

This are some of my personal projects.
The public repos contain code in Java, Python, 
C, C#, SQL and a few more. 

I can say I'm fluent using Java, C# and JavaScript. 
But I'm more fluent in converting functional software from user requirements. 

Feel free to take a look and reach if any questions 🙋🏻‍♂️
